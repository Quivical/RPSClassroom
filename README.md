# RPSClassroom

This is a very simple MUD I made for my CompSci class my first semester of college. 

All of the source code is available for use under my custom license (see LICENSE.md),
but if you'd just like to play the game all you need to do is download 
RPSClassroom.zip, unpack it, and double click the .jar!

Have fun!
